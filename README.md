# GTNH Calculator

This is an archive branch for GTNH 2.7.4. It will not receive any updates.
The main repo is here: https://github.com/ShadowTheAge/gtnh

A calculator for GregTech: New Horizons recipes and production chains.
Large parts of this project were written using AI assistance, so code style and quality are all over the place.
I just wanted to quickly put together something I can use to calculate GTNH chains. After this goal is done, it won't be an actively maintained project.

Data building is done using the NESQL Exporter mod and a C# processing tool. See [export/README.md](export/README.md) for detailed instructions.
